## Do Not Coach:

Coaching is the coach’s job—not the parents’. Even if it’s hard, let your children learn at their own pace, even if it means they fail. Jiu-Jitsu is complex, and every child learns differently. You’re always welcome to join an adult class to see how challenging it really is.

Encourage your kids to speak with the coach directly if they have concerns. Learning to advocate for themselves is a crucial part of training.

## Failure:

Let your children fail. Never make them feel that failure is bad. Results don’t matter—effort and trying do. Kids need to feel safe enough to open up and make mistakes. If they’re too focused on meeting your (or my) expectations, they can’t truly learn.

Don’t scare them. Yes, it’s a combat sport, and yes, they might get hurt—sometimes in scary ways. But they need to understand their bodies aren’t made of glass. Pain passes, and fear is a poor teacher when trying to learn.

Avoid projecting your own hopes or fears onto them. If kids feel pressured to please you, they’ll lose enjoyment in training.

## Play & Fun:

Even though we, as coaches, take training seriously, kids should see it as a game. Like in a video game, they learn "moves" to win within the rules. Their goal is to get as good as possible—but it’s still just a game. No consequences, no punishments or rewards for performance. The point is to have fun. No fun = no training. No training = no progress.

The only rewards or corrections should be for social behavior—never for physical performance, especially in sparring.

## Avoid Unrealistic Expectations:

Some kids show early talent, but becoming a pro athlete takes far more. If your child loves training, celebrate their passion. Pressuring them to achieve quick results will kill that passion.

## Motivation:

Depending on age and maturity, expect some responsibility from them. Not every class will be a positive experience. Skipping training after a bad day means missing the chance to overcome challenges. Encourage consistency—even when they don’t feel like it—to build discipline.

## Teammates:

Jiu-Jitsu can’t be learned alone. Kids must work together, not compete. If they overly correct partners or react poorly during drills, others will struggle to learn with them. If they rely on brute force instead of technique in sparring, they’ll become unpopular training partners—and without partners, they can’t learn.

## Emotions:

Emotions are human, but kids must learn to control them to train effectively. Jealousy, anger, or extreme shyness make interaction difficult. Social skills are key to long-term progress. Help them understand and manage emotions related to training.

### Rules for Parents:

1. Don’t coach. The coach coaches; kids listen. Parents support with positivity.
2. Discourage rivalry. Encourage cooperation.
3. No comparisons. Let kids learn at their own pace.
4. Don’t instill fear. Build their confidence to face challenges.
5. No pressure. Let them decide how involved they want to be.
6. Promote good social behavior. Encourage respect and teamwork.
