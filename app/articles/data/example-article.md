### Quotes

> This is a blockquote. It can be used to highlight important information or quotes.

## Using Frontmatter

At the top of the markdown file, you'll notice a section enclosed by `---`. This is called frontmatter and contains metadata about the article:

- **title**: The title of the article
- **excerpt**: A brief summary of the article
- **author**: The author's name
- **date**: The publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **tags**: An array of tags that describe the article content
- **coverImage**: URL to the cover image for the article

## Conclusion

This is just a simple example to demonstrate how to structure your markdown articles. You can create rich, informative content using markdown's simple syntax.

Happy writing!
