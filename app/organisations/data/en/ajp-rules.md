# ARTICLE 1: REFEREEING

## 1.1 AUTHORITY OF THE REFEREE

**1.1.1** The referee is the highest authority in a match.

**1.1.2** The referee's ruling on the result of each match is incontestable.

**1.1.3** The ruling on the result of a match may only be changed under the following circumstances:

• If the score on the board has been misread;

• If the athlete declared the winner submitted their opponent using an illegal hold previously unnoticed by the referee.

• If the athlete has been disqualifed erroneously for using a legitimate hold. In this case, if the match was interrupted and the athlete disqualifed prior to the athlete under attack tapping out, the match shall be restarted at the center of the match area and the attacking athlete shall be awarded 2 points. In the event that the athlete under attack should tap out prior to the interruption and disqualifcation, the athlete performing the hold shall be declared the winner.

_Note: Subjective referee coordinator interpretations of points, advantages or penalties are fnal and not subject to change._

### 1.1.4 To overturn the outcome of a match, the following conditions should be observed:

• The referee can consult the event's referee coordinator, but the fnal decision as to whether to overturn or not overturn a result is the referee's to make.

• The referee coordinator should consult the event's center table regarding how the bracket has progressed and may only authorize the overturning of a result if the bracket has not progressed to the next stage.

## 1.2 REFEREEING FORMAT

**1.2.1** The organizers of the tournament may opt to appoint three referees for a single match whenever they deem it necessary.

• In this case, two corner referees shall be seated in chairs placed at opposing corners of the match area.

•The corner referees bear the same powers as the central referee, and all points, advantages or penalties awarded must be confrmed by at least two of the three referees.

• Should there be a consensus between the corner referees and the central referee, the corner referees shall remain seated in the chairs at the corners of the match area.

• Should there be a difference of opinion with the central referee , the corner referees should stand up and signal for points, advantages or penalties to be awarded or subtracted, using the gestures defned in this rule book.

• Should there be a discrepancy between all three referees on points to be awarded for the same move, the intermediary decision shall count.

E.g. When one referee awards a guard pass, the second awards an advantage and the third asks that points be subtracted, the advantage shall be recorded on the scoreboard.

• If the referee decides to disqualify an athlete due to the athlete's accumulation of four penalties (minor faults or stalling), the referee will make the minor fault gesture before

stopping the match. If at least one of the side referees repeats the gesture, the referee's decision is confrmed and they are authorized to stop the match.

• If the referee decides to disqualify an athlete due to the athlete committing a major fault, they will make the gesture before stopping the match. If at least one of the side referees repeats the gesture,the referee's decision is confrmed and they are authorized to stop the match.

• When a match ends with a draw in points, advantages and penalties, the central referee will place the two athletes in their starting position (one to their left and one to their right). The referee will take two steps back and make a gesture for the side referees to stand up. After the side referees are standing, the central referee will take a step forward with their right leg. After they do so, all three referees raise either their right or left arm in the air. This will signify the athlete each referee believes to be the winner. The central referee will then declare the winner chosen by a majority of the referees.

### 1.2.2 Whenever possible, the AJP will use an additional referee with access to video replay for the correction of awarded points, advantages or penalties on the scoreboard.

• After the referee with access to the video replay has reached a decision on how to correctly adjust the current score, they will communicate the decision via the radio system.

• The central referee cannot contest the decision reached by the referee with access to the video replay.

• The video referee is not authorized to make decisions on whether a submission attempt is dangerous enough to worthy of an advantage or not, this will be solely the responsibility of the mat referee.

• For matches where a competitor is allowed to have a matside coach, the matside coach is authorized to stand and make the VAR gesture to request a video review of a situation in the match directly after it happens. If the video review determines the mat referee's judgement was incorrect, the matside coach will retain their right to challenge again later in the match. If the video review determines the mat referee was correct, the matside coach will lose their right for further challenges.

## 1.3 REFEREE DUTIES

**1.3.1** It is a referee's duty to summon the athletes into the match area to initiate the match.

**1.3.2** It is a referee's duty to do a fnal check to be sure requirements – such as attire, hygiene, etc. – are being met. Should an athlete not meet any of the requirements, it is the referee's duty to determine whether the requirement can be met within a determined amount of time.

**1.3.3** It is a referee's duty to position the athletes in the match area prior to the match.

• Points awarded to the athlete on the referee's right shall be signaled using the referee's right arm,which is distinguished from the left arm by a red armband, indicating the points should be marked on the red section of the scoreboard.

• Points awarded to the athlete on the referee's left shall be signaled using the referee's left arm,which does not bear an armband, and the points will be marked on the blue section of the scoreboard.

**1.3.4** It is a referee's duty to call a start to the match.

**1.3.5** It is a referee's duty to intervene in a match when they deem it necessary.

Note: When the referee stops the match for any reason, the athletes must maintain their current position to the best of their ability.

**1.3.6** It is a referee's duty to make sure the athletes fulfll their obligation to compete within the combat area.

•When 2/3 of at least one of the athlete's bodies is outside the combat area in a stabilized position on the ground, the referee should stop the match and, noting the position of each athlete, restart the match at the center of the match area with the athletes in positions identical to those they were in at the moment of stoppage.

• While standing, when one of the athletes steps into the safety area (unless a takedown attempt has already been initiated), or when 2/3 of the athletes' bodies are outside the combat area during not-yet-stabilized ground fghting,the referee shall interrupt the match and stand both athletes up in the center of the combat area.

• When an athlete has a submission hold in place in the outlying safety area, the referee should not interrupt the match.

•When an athlete has a submission hold in place and the opponent defends by moving to outside the outlying safety area, the referee should stop the match and restart the match at the center of the match area with the athletes standing. In this case, when the referee deems it clearly apparent the athlete under attack initiated the movement that led to exiting the match area, they shall signal for 2 points to be added to the score of the athlete performing the submission hold, as described in item 3.1.1.

• When one athlete takes their opponent to the outlying safety area while trying to stabilize a scoring position, the referee shall wait, whenever possible, for an athlete to stabilize the position for 3 seconds before stopping the match. If this happens, the referee will give the points and then restart the match in the center of the combat area.

• Points or advantages will be assessed for counting up until the safety area and any movements performed outside the safety area will not be eligible for counting.

• When the match exits the combat area due to the movement of an athlete attacking a submission hold, the referee will not mark 2 points after stopping the match. Instead, the referee may give an advantage depending on the proximity of the submission, while respecting the rules of advantages (Article 5th).

**1.3.7** It is a duty of referees overseeing under-12-years-old-division matches to protect the athlete's spinal column by positioning themselves behind the child when lifted off the ground by the opponent, as in the case of a triangle or closed guard.

**1.3.8** It is a referee's duty to signal every penalty, advantage or point scored by each athlete.

**1.3.9** It is a referee's duty to punish and disqualify athletes.

• When the situation envisaged in item 6.2.2 (V – When an athlete performs an unintentional movement that puts their opponent in a penalizable position) arises and neither athlete has a submission in hold, the referee should stop the match and replace the athletes in regular position. The referee will then restart the match, punishing the athlete responsible.

• When there is a situation with a single-leg with the head on the outside, arising either by a takedown attempt or any other movement coming from the ground with the athletes on their knees, the referee shall act in the following way:

• For youth and younger divisions and white belts, the referee will stop the match and restart the match with both athletes standing. No penalties will be given to either athlete.

• For the other divisions the referee shall not interfere with the match.

**1.3.10** It is a referee's duty to summon medical staff to the match area.

**1.3.11** It is a referee's duty to call an end to the match upon reaching regulation time.

**1.3.12** It is a referee's duty to announce the result of the match.

# ARTICLE 6: FAULTS

Faults are disciplinary or technical infractions addressed in the rules that are committed by athletes before, during or after a match.

### 6.1 DISCIPLINARY FAULTS

- **6.1.1** When an athlete directs profane language or obscene gestures at their opponent, the center table,table ofﬁcials, referee or public, prior to, during or after a match.

- **6.1.2** When an athlete exhibits hostile behavior towards an opponent, referee or any other member of the organizing committee or public, prior to, during or after a match.

- **6.1.3** When an athlete bites, pulls hair, strikes or applies pressure to the genitals or eyes, or intentionally uses a traumatic blow of any kind (such as punches, elbows, knees, head butts, kicks, etc).

- **6.1.4** When an athlete exhibits offensive or disrespectful behavior towards an opponent or the public through words or gestures during a match or in celebrating victory.

- **6.1.5** When one or both of the athletes disregard the seriousness of the competition or perform actions simulating a fake combat.

- **6.1.6** When an athlete exhibits attitudes considered incompatible with the competition environment or commits any other misconduct, even if it is carried out prior to or following the match.

## 6.2 TECHNICAL FAULTS

Technical faults are divided into:

- Stalling

- Minor Faults

- Major Faults

### 6.2.1 Stalling

Classifed similarly to minor faults, stalling entails:

- **A-** Stalling is defned by one athlete clearly not pursuing positional progression in a match.

- **B-** When neither athlete demonstrates combativeness simultaneously during a combat situation.

- **C-** When both athletes pull guard at the same time, the referee will start a 20 second countdown. At the end of this 20 second countdown, as long as neither of the athletes have a submission hold in place or are close to completing a point scoring movement, the referee will stop the match and give a penalty to both athletes. This applies even if both athletes are moving. After giving both penalties, the referee will restart the match in standing position.

Stalling is not declared when an athlete is defending themself from an opponent's attacks from side control, mount, back mount or back control positions.

- **E-** An athlete will not be penalized for stalling when in mount, back mount or back control positions, as long as the characteristics of the technical position are respected.

If an athlete is in the 50/50 guard position and grips the lapel or the belt of their opponent, the athlete will immediately receive an 'Action!' call and has 10 seconds to pursue positional progression. If positional progression has not been achieved by the end of the 10 second period the athlete will receive a penalty for stalling as described in rule 7.3.1, regardless of intention.

**Examples of situations constituting stalling:**

• When an athlete, upon achieving side control position on an opponent, does not seek further positional progression.

• When an athlete in an opponent's guard does not seek to pass guard and at the same time prevents the opponent from seeking positional progression from guard.

• When an athlete playing guard wraps their arms around the opponent's back or performs any other controlling movement preventing the opponent from moving while also not intending to achieve a submission or positional progression themselves.

When a standing athlete grabs and maintains their hand on the opponent's belt, preventing the opponent from completing a takedown movement and not attempting an attack of any kind themselves.

\*The examples above are merely illustrative and do not represent the full array of situations that may be deemed stalling.

### 6.2.2 Minor Faults

- **A-** When a standing athlete kneels, sits (remaining in the position) or pulls guard without a grip.

- **B-** When a standing athlete fees the bounds of the match area, avoiding combat with the opponent.

- **C-** When a standing athlete pushes their opponent outside the match area without clear intent of attempting a submission or scoring.

- **D-** When an athlete on the ground avoids combat by sliding themself outside the match area.

- **E-** When an athlete on the ground stands to escape combat and does not return to combat on the ground.

- **F-** When an athlete breaks the grip of the opponent pulling guard and does not return to combat on the ground.

- **G-** When an athlete intentionally removes their own Gi or belt, causing the match to be stopped.

- **J-** When an athlete communicates with someone, orally or through gestures, in a manner that contradicts a decision made by the referee. This also applies if the athlete makes the gesture to request a video replay. The request for a video replay must be made by the athlete's coach, not the athlete themself.

- **K-** When an athlete disobeys a command from the referee.

- **L-** When an athlete exits the mat area after a match but before the referee has announced the result.

- **M-** When an athlete deliberately runs away from the match area to avoid an inferior position or consolidation of the opponent's score.

_In this case and only this case, the referee must mark the athlete who fed the match area with a penalty and award their opponent with 2 points on the scoreboard. The marked penalty must follow the sequence of penalties._

- **N-** For No-Gi Jiu-Jitsu, when an athlete grabs hold of their uniform or that of their opponent in any way.

- **O-** When an athlete places a hand or foot on their opponent's face.

- **P-** When an athlete intentionally places their foot in their opponent's belt.

- **Q-** When an athlete intentionally places their foot on the lapel of their opponent's Gi without also gripping that same lapel with their hand.

- **R-** When an athlete places a foot in the lapel behind the opponent's neck, with or without gripping it.

- **S-** When an athlete uses their own belt or the opponent's belt to assist in a choke or any other circumstance in a match while the belt is untied.

- **T-** When an athlete takes more than 20 seconds to adjust their uniform. The athlete is allowed 20 seconds per element of their uniform (20 seconds for their Gi top and belt, 20 seconds for the identifcation belt, 20 seconds for their Gi pants and 20 seconds for retying their hair when necessary.)

This includes any and all attacks initiated by jumping guard, such as but not limited to fying triangles and fying armbars. The referee will then stand both athletes up.

Note: Should an athlete be defending a takedown or sweep when they jump guard, the opponent shall also be awarded 2 points for the technique in progress before the penalty.

- **X-** When an athlete exhibits attitudes not appropriate for the competition environment, but not to the extent that they qualify as a disciplinary fault as described in item 6.1.

- **L-** When an athlete performs a suplex movement that forces the opponent's head or neck into the ground.

_Note: The suplex takedown is defned by the attacking athlete lifting the opponent at the waist in order to take them down by throwing them backwards or sideways to the ground.

# TECHNICAL FAULTS – ILLEGAL MOVES

### KNEE REAPING

Knee reaping is characterized by one of the athletes placing their thigh behind the leg of their opponent and passing their calf on top of the opponent's body above the knee, placing their foot beyond the vertical midline of the body and applying pressure on their opponent's knee from the outside to the inside, while keeping the foot of the leg at risk trapped between their hip and armpit.

It is not necessary for the athlete to hold the foot of their opponent for the foot to be considered trapped.

### BODY'S LIMIT BODY'S LIMIT

For the purposes of this rule, when one athlete is standing and bearing their weight on the foot of the same leg as the knee in danger, the foot will be considered trapped.

### MAJOR FAULT

### For Purple Belt Athletes and below

When the two athletes are seated with their legs crossed but in a legal position as illustrated by the frst image, and one of the athletes stands up, causing the athlete on bottom to be in an illegal position as illus- trated by the second image. This is because when standing, the foot that was loose and is now stepping on the ground is considered a trapped foot

&nbsp;

In this situation, the referee must stop the match, then place athlete B in a sitting position and athlete A standing at a suffcient distance to allow new grips and then continue the match

If the situation shown in image 2 occurs after a sweep, the referee must wait 3 seconds to defne the sta- bilization and in sequence : stop the match, award 2 points for athlete A who is on top, place athlete B in a sitting position and athlete A standing at a suffcient distance to allow new grips and continue the match

### For Brown and Black Belt Athletes

The referee will not interrupt the match. No penalty will be applied exclusively in this case.
When the athlete turns inside from a 50/50 guard, and at the beginning of the turn their opponent is step-ping on the ground with the foot that is in the guard, it is considered a trapped foot
